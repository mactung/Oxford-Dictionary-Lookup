Reason for requesting 'alarms' permission:
The 'alarms' permission is required to schedule periodic checks for the "Random Practice Mode". This feature allows users to set a timer (e.g., every 15, 30, or 60 minutes) to receive vocabulary practice quizzes while browsing, helping them reinforce their learning through spaced repetition. The alarm ensures these checks occur reliably at the user-defined intervals without keeping background scripts permanently running, which saves system resources.

Reason for requesting 'storage' permission:
The 'storage' permission is essential for saving the user's personal vocabulary list, quiz progress, and extension settings locally on their device. This allows the extension to function offline and ensures user data remains private and persistent across browser sessions.

Reason for requesting 'bookmarks' permission:
The 'bookmarks' permission is used to display the user's bookmark folders directly on the New Tab dashboard. This provides users with "Quick Access" to their favorite sites alongside their vocabulary tools, making the New Tab a central hub for their productivity and learning. The extension only reads bookmarks to display them and does not modify or delete them.

Reason for requesting host permissions (https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/*):
This host permission is strictly required to fetch dictionary definitions, phonetics, and audio examples directly from the Oxford Learner's Dictionary website when a user looks up a word. The extension parses the HTML from this specific domain to present a clean, ad-free definition card to the user. No other data is accessed or sent to this domain.
